# Drugs_SideEffects_Classification

## Data Science and Analytics Internship - TCS iON
This Project shows the Machine Learning Algorithms through what are  the Side Effects of Drugs on people.

### OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to build a classification model that classifies the side effects of a particular drug by age, gender, and race. The model needs to have a good amount of accuracy and meet industry standards

### INTRODUCTION

The project guidelines mention that we are expected to create a model that classifies the trial data of a drug based on age, gender, and race. We were also entrusted with creating a dataset of 4,00,000 patients containing the following details for each patient based on various attributes according to the data: By the end of the project, we should be able to generate a dataset, produce insightful visualizations, clean the dataset, sanitize it, and preprocess the data to perform data partitioning and handle missing values. Create training and testing sets. Build a classifier and fit the data to the model.

### OUTCOME/CONCLUSION

After the implementation of the Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms, the side effect of the drug was best modeled by the [Decision Tree classifier] without doing any scaling or standardization (Accuracy of 97.71%).
